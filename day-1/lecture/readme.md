## Nodejs- Basics

- Javascript - when js was created it was meant to run only in browser - build a website -frontend
- ryan- run js outside browser
- other run time environments - bun , deno and node
- node.js - runtime environment
  why node?
  why we need js outside the browser
  - to be able to do thing that we can't just do from browser -accessing files, write scripts

### backend -> server -> runtime environment

- node -v gives node version
- node gives a environment like replit
- node REPL READ, EVAL, PRINT , LOOP
- to get out of this environment `ctrl+D`
- machine does not understand js syntax like console.log(1)
- JS --> whatever the system understand
 === Node architecture ===
- BROWSERS -
  ------ chrome - v8 engine
  ------ firebox - spiderMonkey
- Node - v8 engine + more things API's, methods and modules

- `module.exports = num`
- `const num = require("/file.js")`
- importing from external modules
- importing from node's inbuild api's

- node itself have some inbuild node modules / API's
