##### EXPRESS -

- ###### NEM here E stands for express
- what is express => fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node.js
- Issue's with requests using http
  - not intutive
  - so many thing like res.write, res.end
  - so many if else condition for GET and POST request
- EXPRESS
    - built on top of http itself => a better version of http
